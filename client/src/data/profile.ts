  introduction: "is a Danish technologist, inventor, and entrepreneur known for identifying and implementing transformative technologies ahead of mainstream adoption. Born in 1970, Lyneborg has built a career spanning robotics education, corporate IT leadership, AI innovation, 3D art instruction, music technology, and game development. In 2025, he founded FRITS AI APS, a Copenhagen-based company providing GDPR-compliant AI chatbot solutions for European enterprises seeking to leverage ChatGPT while maintaining regulatory compliance. His earlier pioneering work includes founding LetsMakeRobots.com (2008-2015), one of the world's first global robotics communities, and securing an international patent for spam-free email systems (2005). As an educator, Lyneborg taught 3D visualization and digital sculpture at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts for seven years (2015-2022), influencing hundreds of artists. His recent innovations include ArrangerKing (2024), a music production plugin that revolutionizes arrangement workflows, and collaboration with renowned business executive Lars Kolind on AI automation workshops for corporate leaders. Throughout his career, Lyneborg has demonstrated a consistent pattern of recognizing disruptive technologies early—from open source web solutions in 2003 and robotics communities in 2008 to autonomous drones in 2010 and early LLM creative implementations in 2023.",

This activity, which combined elements of traditional skateboarding with surfing techniques, reflected his interest in balance, momentum, and motion—themes that also appeared in his robotics work. Longboarding provided him with a physical counterpoint to his technical interests, allowing him to experience motion and physics directly rather than through digital or mechanical intermediaries."
