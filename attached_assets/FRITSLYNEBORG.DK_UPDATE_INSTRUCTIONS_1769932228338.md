## CRITICAL UPDATES REQUIRED

### 1. ArrangerKing Project - EXPAND SIGNIFICANTLY

**Current Status:** Website mentions ArrangerKing briefly as "a music production plugin that revolutionizes arrangement workflows"

**Required Action:** Expand ArrangerKing section to match the comprehensive information now available

**Add the following details:**

```

**Price:** USD $54 (sale: $40.50 + VAT in EU/UK)  
**Website:** https://arrangerking.com

**The Problem It Solves:**
Revolutionary music arrangement plugin that solves the "8-bar syndrome" - the common problem where producers start with great ideas but get lost in details instead of finishing tracks. Provides what most DAWs lack: a clear visual structure to help creative flow, ensuring great ideas develop into complete, dynamic tracks rather than remaining 4 or 8 bar loops.

**Professional Reviews:**
- **GEARNEWS Review (Oct 15, 2024):** Rating 4.4/5.0
  - "ArrangerKing: More than a Plug-in – a Tool to Help You Complete Your Music"
  - "A real game changer. It makes it possible to structure songs faster without getting lost in the details."
  - "Not only does ArrangerKing offer a solution to a common problem, but it will also bring a new dynamic to the daily production routine of many musicians."

**User Testimonials:**
- "This is freaking revolutionary! Brilliant idea and so incredibly well executed." - Pete (GEARNEWS)
- "Exactly what I needed. Thanks for making this. Works like a charm." - @igorwagner8955
- "I've bought it two weeks ago and I really like it. Switching between different arrangement ideas has never been that easy." - Pascal (GEARNEWS)

**Key Features:**
- Drag-drop arrangement guides with MIDI and Audio
- Lightning fast arrangement with mute patterns
- Live MIDI generation in sync with arrangement
- Non-destructive editing - one click changes all choruses
- Customizable templates and community sharing
- Integrates with all major DAWs (Ableton, Logic, FL Studio, Cubase, Pro Tools, Maschine, Reaper, Studio One, Bitwig, Nuendo)

**Philosophy:** NOT AI-generated music. Enhances YOUR creativity with proven arrangement techniques.

**Community Recognition:** Acclaimed as "the fastest way to arrange tracks" in music technology history.
